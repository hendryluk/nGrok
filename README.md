nGrok
=====

.NET port of Grok, a powerful pattern-matching/reacting tool (https://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/wiki/Grok).
The original Grok was on C/Ruby targetting Linux. This work is based on the pure Ruby port which removed Linux dependencies from the original Grok, allowing it to run on other OS.
